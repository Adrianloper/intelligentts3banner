# Intelligent Teamspeak 3 Banner
Intelligent Teamspeak 3 Banner with many Server Informations

Just need to enter Serverquery Informations and connect to Database

NEEDED:

-Webspace: For the PHP-Script and the Teamspeak 3 PHP Framework

-Database: For some messages in the banner

-Teamspeak 3 Server: (Of course :D)

-[Teamspeak 3 PHP Framework](https://github.com/planetteamspeak/ts3phpframework)

Place the Teamspeak 3 PHP Framework files in an archive named "teamspeak 3" and place the "banner.php" file in the same direction where the "teamspeak3"-archive is located.
Don't place the "banner.php" file in the "teamspeak3" archive!

Now you need a mysql database with a row named ts and you need to enter the connection-details in the banner.php file.
You need to enter the serverquery data in the banner.php file, too.
